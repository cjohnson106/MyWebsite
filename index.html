        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, My name is Cannon Johnson. I was born and raised in Kennewick, WA, and lived there until I was 15. My family and I moved to Arizona which is where I ended up graduating high school. After graduation, I moved back to Kennewick to start my college career. I went to Columbia Basin College for 2 years until I transferred to Eastern Washington University. Since being at Eastern, I have been working on obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication of Design and receiving a certificate in User Experience.

            It is my last year as a student here at EWU and I am expecting to graduate at the end of winter 2023. I have been working on my graphic design for around 4 years now. I started in 2018 by doing solo projects while going to CBC. I taught myself Photoshop and Illustrator and practiced for 2 years before coming to EWU. Once I was at EWU is when I really started practicing more and more to hone my design skills. Since being here I have got better at Photoshop and Illustrator while also learning a bunch of new programs and skills that I am still working on to this day. My interest in the design world would be making logos, posters, and UX. Outside of design I mainly enjoy watching sports like hockey, F1, and lacrosse.

            I like to pride myself on my work ethic, my creativity, and my ability to adapt to situations where I need to fill in and help the team. My strongest skill as of now would have to be my overall graphic design ability. In the future, I am really looking forward to enhancing my UX and Web design ability. I have a big passion for UX and Web design and am really hoping to become more proficient and confident in my work.
